# MRMFrontEndInterview
Screening test for MRM javascript developers. The idea of this task is to make the tests pass. 
You should take the code used here, clone it locally, and submit your solutions in a private link to us.

Timebox yourself to each task, some are more difficult than others. We don't expect you to solve every problem. 
The main test is discussing how you got on afterwards.

## Setup

To get set up, pull down this repo and cd into the folder.
 - Make sure you have `npm`, `node` and all that good stuff already installed 
 - Run `npm install`
 - Tests can be found in `/test`, use these as your guide and starting point
 - Write your solutions within the corresponding files inside `/app`
 - Run `npm test` to run your tests.
 - Make them all green!

## Rules

 - Expected time to complete task: **4 hours**
 - You can't install any more packages/frameworks. Use what's there.
 - You can't change any files outside of `/app`. Don't remove any template code within any of the task files either.
 - Feel free to read StackOverflow/Google. We're not looking for a copy/paste though. Just demonstrate understanding.
 - You don't need to be too clever with your code. We're looking for something clear and understandable.
 - Use ES6 syntax where you think it's applicable.
 - Commenting your code is always appreciated.
 - Have fun!
 
 We're happy to talk through any issues you might have with getting up and running. Just get in touch.  :)
